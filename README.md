Predictive modeling to identify drivers of e-cigarette usage using statistical and ML techniques
# E-Cigarette Usage Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes behavioral, demographic, and health-related factors influencing **e-cigarette usage among college students**, with the goal of identifying key risk drivers and predicting usage patterns using statistical and machine learning models.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
E-cigarette usage among young adults has increased rapidly, but the behavioral and awareness-related factors driving usage are not always clear. This project aims to understand **what factors most strongly influence usage** and whether usage can be reliably predicted from survey data.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: University health survey dataset
- Size: **200+ survey responses**
- Features: **20+ behavioral, demographic, and awareness variables**
- Target variable: E-cigarette usage (Yes / No)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- R (statistical computing)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering & encoding
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC)

---

## 🔍 Approach
- Cleaned and transformed survey data for modeling
- Performed exploratory analysis to identify behavioral patterns
- Built and compared multiple classification models
- Evaluated models using standard performance metrics

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Alcohol consumption and stress levels** were strong positive predictors of e-cigarette usage
- **Health-risk awareness** showed a negative association with usage
- The best-performing model achieved **~93% prediction accuracy**

---

## 💡 Conclusion
The analysis highlights that e-cigarette usage is driven more by **behavioral and lifestyle factors** than demographics alone. These insights can support targeted awareness and prevention strategies among college populations.
